Python 3.5/numpy package for multislice simulation of pseudo-relativistic electron diffraction, and some auxilary functions (making and manipulating lattices, evaluating potentials, etc.) for the McMorran lab at the University of Oregon.


Includes geometric/Bragg diffraction modelling functions (ported from Matlab for comparison and utility) and multislice routines. For the multislice theory, see http://muller.research.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/WEELS/summer06/mtutor.pdf


Dependencies:
	-Python 3.5
	-NumPy
	-Numba


To use:
	-Install dependencies, clone repository, add directory to path
	-run multisl_diff.py as a script to load functions.
